# 🚀 Okleevo: Your SME's One-Stop Platform for Business Growth & Productivity

## The SME Challenge: Too Many Tools, Too Little Time

As a UK SME owner, you're juggling multiple responsibilities every day. You're wearing many hats - accountant, marketer, sales manager, customer service rep, and more. And to manage all these roles, you're probably paying for:

- 💰 Accounting software (£20-50/month)
- 💰 CRM system (£25-75/month)
- 💰 Email marketing tool (£15-40/month)
- 💰 Project management app (£10-30/month)
- 💰 Invoicing software (£15-35/month)
- 💰 Booking system (£20-45/month)
- 💰 Form builder (£10-25/month)
- 💰 Document management (£15-30/month)

**Total Monthly Cost: £130-330+ per month**
**Annual Cost: £1,560-3,960+**

Plus the hidden costs:
- ⏰ Hours spent switching between platforms
- 🔄 Manual data entry across systems
